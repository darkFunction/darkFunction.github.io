### Experience {#experience}

Utelly Ltd.
: *Senior iOS Developer*
  __2015-Present__
Joined at an early stage as the second of three iOS developers responsible for building the iPhone and iPad experience. As Utelly is a small startup, developers play a flexible role and as such I contributed to product design and direction, set up of build systems, documentation, team tools, and methods of rapidly prototyping new themes and features for deployment, alongside building the application and encouraging good code and workflow practices. Was also involved in some research into computer vision and GPU programming (CUDA) which I hugely enjoyed.

Badoo Ltd.
: *Senior iOS Developer*
  __2011-2015__
  Worked as part of a large and growing team to build the company's main product, <i>Badoo</i>, (which caters for over 200 million users across all platforms), as well as the apps <i>Hot or Not</i> and <i>Blendr</i>. As the team scaled up I moved into a small core team responsible for the iOS 'platform' library on top of which the feature team could develop new features rapidly. Setup and managed TeamCity agents and build configurations before handing over to a full-time release engineer. Developed the greenfield project <i>Bumble</i> (with the former co-founder and designers of <i>Tinder</i>) from the start as part of a smaller internal team.

weComm Ltd. / OpenText Corporation
: *Senior iOS Developer*
  __2009-2011__
  Responsible for developing client-side iPhone and iPad applications, with flexible, dynamic GUI construction; either using, customising or reimplementing almost all native components. Worked as part of a team of three to extend and maintain a core client upon which the App Store releases were produced. These include: <i>NBA Gametime</i> team apps, <i>Turner Classic Movies</i>, <i>HotelScene</i>, <i>SportsBoost</i>, and <i>MiniVTV</i>. Refactored the client architecture heavily throughout my employment to dramatically improve readability and code quality as well as optimising performance and memory usage. Set up a Continuous Integration server using Jenkins and was responsible for maintaining the build machine (based on Java / Ant).

Cobra Mobile Ltd.
: *Mobile Developer*
  __2006-2009__
	Worked as the sole programmer (working closely with an artist) on the following titles: <i>Powerpuff Girls: Mojo Madness</i> (J2ME), <i>Dastardly & Muttley in Their Flying Machines</i> (J2ME), <i>Beat the Intro</i> (J2ME), <i>Numba</i> (J2ME), <i>Mouse About</i> & <i>Mouse About Lite</i> (iOS), <i>Nose About</i> (official Comic Relief game 2009) (iOS), and <i>Stuck</i> (iOS). Ported the J2ME games to approximately 70 handsets in multiple languages, as well as porting inherited projects such as <i>Family Guy</i> and <i>Mind Games</i>. Worked as part of a small team on <i>Lego Batman</i> for the iPhone, writing two of the mini-games: <i>Fear in the Sky</i> and <i>Penguin Pinball</i>. Developed numerous prototypes including an isometric demo in J2ME. The job involved overcoming severe device limitations and maintaining and refactoring the game engine.
