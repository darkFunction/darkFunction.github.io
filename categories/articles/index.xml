      <description>Lucid dreaming is the conscious realisation that you are dreaming, becoming fully aware and &amp;#8216;awake&amp;#8217; while still asleep. Most people have had one at some time or another. The concept garnered some popularity around the release of Inception and was a main theme in the film Waking Life.
Usually when you tell someone you are interested in lucid dreaming, you might as well have said that you dowse for spirit crystals under the light of a full moon.</description>
