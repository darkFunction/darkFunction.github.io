      <description>Just a little status update for the Jalapeno that has been chugging along nicely for just over a month now. I replaced the obnoxious fan with a quieter one, and about 2 weeks ago I flashed the firmware, putting the speed up to about 7.5GH/s. This speed increase coincided with the huge difficulty rise earlier in the month, so the graph looks more even than it would if it were still running at stock speed.</description>

      <description>My BFL Jalapeno finally arrived. It&amp;rsquo;s a cute little box but the fan is really whirring away, so I ordered a replacement. It&amp;rsquo;s sitting in the living room plugged into a Pi which is also acting as a backup file server. I&amp;rsquo;m monitoring cgminer on this box through my VPS which has a tmux screen pane devoted to it, so that I can keep an eye on it without having to login all the time.</description>
