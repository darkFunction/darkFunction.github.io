      <description>Inspired by a very interesting Defcon presentation about stock spammers from 2011, I thought it would be interesting (and maybe profitable?) to monitor the frequency of low-cap cryptocurrency mentions on Twitter, the theory being that pump groups and spammers are likely to &amp;lsquo;hype&amp;rsquo; coins before/during large buys in order to manipulate more people into buying.
The free tier on the Twitter streaming API allows you to monitor 400 different terms so I chose to observe the Twitter stock symbol &amp;lsquo;$&amp;rsquo; followed by the coin abbreviations, for example $SIA is Siacoin.</description>
