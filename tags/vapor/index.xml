      <description>Built a website and API backend (https://www.ticketsamaritan.uk/) using Vapor after attending Serverside.swift conference in Berlin. I explored serverless technologies offered by IBM but ultimately Vapor turned out to be a great option and Vapor Cloud especially makes for easy deployment and database hosting.
The site is for travellers to share free tickets and has received postive responses on Reddit. I think it needs a simple app to be really useful but since the API is done this is something that can be put together pretty quickly in the future.</description>
