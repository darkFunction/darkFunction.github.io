      <description>Launched a site called threadpaint.art that lets you generate instructions for neat artworks made from a continuous line of thread.
I tried to build a stepper motor attachment to make building these pieces really easy, and it kinda worked except the wooden chassis was too flexible and caused too much wobble! (See video) Originally I wanted to have a robot arm do it, but nothing has the precision until you start getting into expensive, industrial-level tools.</description>

      <description>Built a website and API backend (https://www.ticketsamaritan.uk/) using Vapor after attending Serverside.swift conference in Berlin. I explored serverless technologies offered by IBM but ultimately Vapor turned out to be a great option and Vapor Cloud especially makes for easy deployment and database hosting.
The hardest part was getting presigned forms working for user image uploads to Amazon S3. I released a tiny util for generating form policies.
The site is for travellers to share free tickets and has received postive responses on Reddit.</description>
